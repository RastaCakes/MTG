        <p>
          Mondial may set and access Mondial cookies on your computer. Upon your first
          visit to Mondial, a cookie is sent to your computer that uniquely identifies
          your browser. A “cookie” is a small file containing a string of characters
          that is sent to your computer and stored on your hard drive when you visit
          a website. Each web site can send its own cookie to your browser. Most browsers
          are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse
          all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent, however if you reject
          cookies, you may not be able to sign into Mondial websites or take full advantage
          of the services therein.
        <br>
        <br>
          Mondial uses cookies for the following general purposes: to track your
          preferences, such as the address or local zip code you enter; to access your
          information when you sign in so we can provide you with your personalized content;
          to display the most appropriate advertisements, based on your interests and activity
          on our web site; and to help us estimate our traffic. Mondial may use other
          companies to show advertisements on some of our pages. The other companies
          set and access their own cookies on your computer. Other companies’ use of
          their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Advertisers
          or other companies do not have access to Mondial’s cookies.
        </p>
        <h3>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h3>
        <p>
          Mondial does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with
           ther people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide products or services
          you’ve requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:
        <br>
        <br>
          We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with Mondial
          under confidentiality agreements. The trusted partners include companies with which
          Mondial may operate co-branded websites or web-pages to expand their services using
          Mondial. These trusted partners may use your personal information to provide services
          to you on our behalf, evaluate the effectiveness of the services, and to help Mondial
          communicate with you about offers from Mondial and our marketing partners. However,
          these companies do not have any independent right to share this information.
        <br>
        <br>
          We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise
          our legal rights or defend against legal claims.
        <br>
        <br>
          We believe it is necessary to share information and in order to investigate, prevent
          or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving
          potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Mondial’s
          terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.
        <br>
        <br>
          We transfer information about you if Mondial is acquired by or merged with another
          company. In this event, Mondial will post a notice on its website before information
          about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
        <br>
        <br>
          Mondial displays targeted advertisements based on personal information, including
          zip code and profile. Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume
          that people who interact with, view, or click on targeted ads meet the targeting
          criteria – for example, men ages 25-34 from a particular geographic area. Mondial
          does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with
          or view a targeted ad. However, by interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting
          to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting
          criteria used to display the ad.
        </p>
        <h3>Links</h3>
        <p>
          The sites displayed as search results or linked to by Mondial’s services are
          developed by people over whom Mondial exercise no control. These other sites
          may place their own cookies on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information.
        <br>
        <br>
          Mondial may present links in a format that enables us to understand whether they
          have been followed. We use this information to understand and improve the quality
          of Mondial’s search technology. For instance, this data helps us determine how
          often users are satisfied with the first result of a query and how often they
          proceed to the later results.
        </p>
        <h3>Your Ability to Edit and Delete Your Account Information and Preferences</h3>
        <p>
          Registered Users can edit their Mondial Account Information, including contact
          preferences, at any time from their “My Account” account management page.
        <br>
        <br>
          We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to Mondial
          services, such as service announcements, administrative messages and the Mondial
          Newsletter, that are considered part of your Mondial Account, without offering
          you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving them.
        <br>
        <br>
          You can delete your Mondial registered account by requesting an account deletion
          via email to info@mondialtechgroup.com. You must provide us with the email address
          of the registered account. After we have confirmed your request via email, we will
          remove access to your personal information from our user database.

        </p>
        <h3>Confidentiality and Security</h3>
        <p>
          We limit access to personal information about you to our employees and agents
          who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to
          provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs.
        <br>
        <br>
          Your information is stored on our servers located in the United States. We treat
          data as an asset that must be protected and use many tools (encryption, passwords,
          physical security, etc.) to protect your personal information against unauthorized
          access to disclosure. However, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access
          transmissions or private communications, and other users may abuse or misuse
          your personal information that they collect from the site. Therefore, although
          we work very hard to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should
          not expect, that your personal information or private communications will
          always remain private. Because email and instant messaging are not recognized
          as secure communications, we request that you not send private information
          to us by email and instant messaging services.
        </p>
        <h3>Third Parties</h3>
        <p>
          This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Mondial does
          not own or control or to people that Mondial does not employ or manage. Mondial’s
          websites may include applications, content and/or ads from third parties that
          may perform user activity tracking in addition to that described herein; Mondial
          accepts no responsibility for said activities. Mondial does not control the
          privacy policies of third parties, and you are subject to the privacy policies
          of those third parties where applicable. We encourage you to ask questions
          before you disclose your personal information to others. For more information
          about each such third party, please refer to the third party’s privacy policy.
        </p>
        <h3>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
        <p>
          We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the amended terms
          on this site. All amended terms automatically take effect 30 days after
          they are initially posted on the site, unless that amendment states otherwise.
          In addition, we will notify you about significant changes in the way we treat
          personal information by sending a notice to the primary email address specified
          in your Mondial account or by placing a prominent notice on our site.
        <br>
        <br>
          If you have any questions, concerns or suggestions, please feel free to send an
          email to info@mondialtechgroup.com and info@mondialrecycling.com.
