      <h1>Service Agreement</h1>
      <p>
        Mondialtechgroup.com and mondialrecycling.com are a service provided by Mondial
        Group, llc, wherein you, the seller, offer to sell to Mondial your equipment
        (hereinafter the “Equipment”) after receiving a “bid” from Mondial. By using
        Mondial’s website and participating in the service, you agree to the terms and
        conditions set forth herein. Additional terms and conditions applicable to the
        use of the site, privacy concerns, specific areas of this site, or to particular
        content or transactions are posted in particular areas of the site and, together
        with these Terms of Sale, govern you use of those areas, content, or transactions.
        These terms, together with applicable additional terms and conditions, are terms
        of a legal agreement between you and Mondial Group, llc, and are collectively
        referred to herein as the “Agreement”.
      </p>
      <h3>Party Responsibility</h3>
      <p>
        Any and all transactions conducted on this site are solely the responsibility
        of Mondial and such visitors.
      </p>
      <h3>Equipment Qualification</h3>
      <p>
        Mondial tries to offer a “bid” for the purchase of every equipment you want to
        sell. While Mondial will strive toward making a bid on all equipment, it does
        reserve the right, in its discretion, to choose not to.
      </p>
      <h3>Equipment Valuation; Equipment Recycling</h3>
      <p>
        All bids will be based on Mondial’s own determination of the equipment value with
        the information you supply us. Mondial will use its discretion to determine the
        equipment value, weighing factors that may include the equipment’s model, functionality,
        and condition. Upon receiving a bid, you have the option of offering for sale your
        equipment to Mondial. If Mondial determines the equipment has nominal value, Mondial
        may bid $0. If you continue and accept of $0, Mondial will accept the equipment in order
        to recycle the equipment according to international environmental standards.
      </p>
      <h3>When sending Mondial your Equipment</h3>
      <p>
        When preparing your equipment, be sure to include all materials you told us about
        when we calculated your bid as well as any other materials that came with your
        equipment or you may have purchased for it. This may include software, accessories,
        adapters, and manuals. Failure to include any items you told us about when the bid
        was calculated, or sending us equipment which does not match your original description,
        may have an impact on the final value of your equipment and may result in a recalculated bid.
      </p>
      <h3>Removing Data From Your Equipment</h3>
      <p>
        For equipment involving devices that store files and personal data on hard drives,
        memory chips or the like, Mondial will use its best efforts to remove all data from
        your equipment, meeting DOD (Department of Defense) standards and the guidelines
        established by the NAID (National Association for Information Destruction).
      </p>
      <h3>Equipment Inspection; Bid Recalculation</h3>
      <p>
        All Equipment is inspected upon pick-up or receipt by Mondial. Mondial has the
        option to accept or deny the equipment. There may be instances when Mondial
        recalculates the original bid for the equipment. If the equipment is as described,
        with all materials described, and received by Mondial in a timely manner (within
        one month of the bid), Mondial will honor all bids made for your equipment. In
        the event Mondial recalculates the bid you shall have the option of accepting or
        rejecting the new bid. If you choose to accept the new bid, you will be paid in
        normal course and in accordance with these service terms. If you choose to reject
        the new bid, Mondial will return the equipment to you at the address from which
        it was originally sent. Mondial will give you five (5) days – from the day Mondial
        recalculates the bid – to accept or reject the new bid. Mondial will also remind
        you of the outstanding new bid one or more times during the period. However, if
        the new bid is neither accepted nor rejected after the 5 days, Mondial will assume
        acceptance of the new bid, and you will be paid the new bid in normal course
        and in accordance with these service terms.
      </p>
      <h3>Condition Defined</h3>
      <p>
        Mondial uses four (4) equipment conditions to grade equipments, ranging from
        “Excellent” to “Poor”. Conditions can widely vary between categories and types
        of equipments. Broadly, Mondial’s equipment definitions are as follows:
      <br>
        <strong>Perfect:</strong> the item is in perfect condition with no scratches,
        scuffs, or signs of use.
      <br>
        <strong>Good:</strong> the item has evidence of normal use, such as light
        scratches or scuffs, but is otherwise 100% functional.
      <br>
        <strong>Fair:</strong> item functions perfectly but has major scratches and/or dents.
      <br>
        <strong>Poor:</strong> the item has physical or functional issues.
        The above definitions are broad guidelines. More specific condition definitions
        are subject to change at Mondial’s discretion.
      </p>
      <h3>Fitness for Sale</h3>
      <p>
        You must own the right, title, and interest in any and all items you seek to sell
        to Mondial. Such items, or the sale and shipment of such items, must not violate
        any applicable laws, statutes, ordinances, or regulations including export laws.
        You are responsible for complying with any and all such laws. Any items you seek
        to sell to Mondial: (1) shall not infringe on third party intellectual property
        rights (including copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets or other proprietary
        rights), (2) shall not be counterfeit, stolen, or fraudulent. You represent and
        warrant that the equipments are free of any liens or encumbrances, including
        third-party software which may not be transferred or for which royalties are due.
        You agree to indemnify Mondial from all claims or losses sustained by Mondial as
        a result of any breach of this warranty.
      </p>
      <h3>Releasing Rights to Equipment</h3>
      <p>
        Once you send or Mondial picks up your equipment, Mondial cannot and does not
        guarantee that it will be able to honor any request for return of the equipment
        and/or any data or information contained in said equipment after processing has begun.
      </p>
      <h3>Risk-of-Loss</h3>
      <p>
        You remain responsible for the risk-of-loss for the equipment until pick-up by
        Mondial personnel or delivery of the same to Mondial facilities. You are responsible
        for any damages that may occur to your equipment or equipment until received
        by Mondial. If Mondial denies your offer to buy your equipment, risk-of-loss
        will be transferred to you at point of return delivery to you by Mondial, provided,
        pursuant to these terms and conditions you request the return of the equipment.
      </p>
      <h3>Passing of Title; All Decisions Are Final</h3>
      <p>
        Title of the equipment passes to Mondial upon the equipment’s acceptance following
        inspection and reception by Mondial. If Mondial does not accept the equipment,
        for whatever reason, title shall not pass and shall remain with you. All decisions
        of acceptance or denial of your offer to sell or Mondial’s purchasing of the
        Equipment by Mondial are final.
      </p>
      <h3>Non-Transferable</h3>
      <p>
        Any offer is non-transferable, not redeemable for any other consideration other
        than what is bid by Mondial, and upon your receipt of the Purchase Price or
        agreed upon consideration, in whatever form sent, it is non-refundable. Prices
        offered by Mondial are subject to, and will, change without notice; Mondial will
        terminate offerings on certain Equipments at anytime and without advanced notice.
      </p>
      <h3>Promotions</h3>
      <p>
        From time to time, and at Mondial’s sole discretion, Mondial may offer promotional
        programs as an incentive to customers. Promotions applicable to payments are applied
        as an increment to the final value of a customer’s equipment or equipment, but they
        are not considered a change in that final value. Promotional programs have explicitly
         defined terms, including but not limited to expiration; usage per person, per
         transaction; and other limitations and restrictions. Unless otherwise stated,
         promotions must be applied at the point of the transaction. Mondial reserves the right,
         in its sole discretion, to cancel or refuse promotions.
      </p>
      <h3>Accuracy of all Information</h3>
      <p>
        Mondial makes every effort to ensure the accuracy of all information that you
        receive in relation to your equipment or equipment. In the event of typographical
        errors, technical inaccuracies, or pricing errors or omissions, Mondial reserves
        the right to correct the error at any point of the process. If Mondial corrects
        the error, Mondial will provide you with the following options: (1) to proceed
        with the transaction based on the corrected information; or (2) to cancel your
        transaction, in which case Mondial will promptly return the equipment back to you.
      </p>
